# SEC EDGAR API Configuration
# Required: The SEC requires a User-Agent header with your name and email
# Set these environment variables before running the pipeline scripts

# Your name or organization name
SEC_USER_NAME="Your Name or Organization"

# Your email address (required by SEC for User-Agent header)
SEC_USER_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"

# Note: These values will override the user_agent settings in config/analysis_config.json
# To use these environment variables:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the example values with your actual information
# 3. The .env file is already in .gitignore to keep your information private
